    <h1><strong>🦈 Bizarre & Powerful Shark Facts</strong></h1>
    <img src="Shark.jpeg" alt="Shark">
    <ul class="facts-list">

      <li>🔹 Sharks have <strong>electroreception</strong>, meaning they can detect the tiny electric fields produced by heartbeat, muscle movement, or even a fish hiding under sand, using organs called <strong>ampullae of Lorenzini</strong>.</li>
      <li>🔹 Some sharks glow in the dark. Species like the swell shark and lanternshark show <strong>biofluorescence</strong>, lighting up in greens and blues that only other sharks can see.</li>
      <li>🔹 Greenland sharks can live for <strong>250–500 years</strong>, making them one of the longest-living vertebrates on the planet, older than the USA as a country.</li>
      <li>🔹 A shark’s skin is made of tiny tooth-like scales called <strong>dermal denticles</strong>, which reduce drag so efficiently that engineers study them for designing faster swimsuits and ships.</li>
      <li>🔹 Sharks don't have bones, their skeletons are made of <strong>cartilage</strong>, which is flexible and lighter, allowing for silent swimming and energy-efficient hunting.</li>
      <li>🔹 A single shark may grow and lose over <strong>30,000 teeth</strong> in its lifetime. Their teeth constantly replace themselves like a conveyor belt.</li>
      <li>🔹 Sharks have an incredible sense of smell, but even more impressive is their <strong>hearing</strong>, they can detect low-frequency sounds from miles away.</li>
      <li>🔹 Some sharks, like the bull shark, can survive in <strong>freshwater</strong>, swimming upriver for hundreds of miles thanks to their unique salt-regulation organs.</li>
