    <ul class="facts-list">
      <li><strong>Male pregnancy:</strong> The male seahorse carries eggs in a brood pouch and can give birth to thousands of tiny young after contractions that look like labor.</li>
      <li><strong>Independent eyes:</strong> Each eye moves independently, so a seahorse can watch two different things at once, sneak attack mode engaged.</li>
      <li><strong>No stomach:</strong> Food passes straight through them, so they must eat almost constantly (dozens of tiny meals a day).</li>
      <li><strong>Terrible swimmers:</strong> They’re among the slowest fish; strong currents can carry them away, so they often anchor to seagrass with their tails.</li>
      <li><strong>Natural armor:</strong> Their bodies are made of bony plates, flexible but tough, a design engineers study for protective materials.</li>
      <li><strong>Unique coronets:</strong> Each seahorse has a distinct crown-like bump (a coronet) on its head, which is as unique as a fingerprint.</li>
      <li><strong>Tiny newborns:</strong> Babies can be the size of a grain of rice and are entirely independent at birth, survival of the fittest starts immediately.</li>
      <li><strong>Underwater clicks:</strong> They produce faint clicking sounds by rubbing skull parts together, a subtle form of communication.</li>
