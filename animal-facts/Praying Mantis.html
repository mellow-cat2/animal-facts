    <ul class="facts-list">

      <li><strong>Ambush predators</strong> Praying mantises are skilled hunters that rely on stealth and patience. They can remain completely motionless for hours, blending perfectly with leaves or branches until their prey comes within striking distance.</li>
      <li><strong>360-degree vision</strong> Their triangular heads can rotate almost completely around, giving them an incredible field of view. Combined with their compound eyes, they can detect the slightest movements and judge distances with astonishing accuracy.</li>
      <li><strong>Powerful front legs</strong> The mantis’s spiked forelegs snap shut in milliseconds, capturing prey before it can escape. They can even take down insects larger than themselves, including small birds and frogs in rare cases.</li>
      <li><strong>Sexual cannibalism</strong> Some female mantises may eat the male after or during mating, but studies suggest this is often strategic. Consuming the male can provide extra nutrients to help produce healthy eggs.</li>
      <li><strong>Incredible camouflage</strong> Mantises mimic leaves, flowers, or sticks, making them almost invisible to both predators and prey. Some species even sway gently as if moved by the wind, adding to the illusion.</li>
      <li><strong>Fast reaction time</strong> Praying mantises can strike at prey in as little as 50 milliseconds. Their reflexes are so fast that high-speed cameras are needed to capture their movements in detail.</li>
      <li><strong>Flying hunters</strong> Some mantis species are capable of flight, which they use to escape predators or to hunt flying insects. Despite their delicate wings, they are surprisingly agile in the air.</li>
      <li><strong>Survival through freezing</strong> Certain mantis species can survive winter by producing antifreeze-like chemicals in their bodies, allowing them to overwinter in cold climates without freezing to death.</li>
