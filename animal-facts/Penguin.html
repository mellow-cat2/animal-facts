    <ul class="facts-list">

      <li>🔹 Penguins have <strong>antifreeze-like proteins in their blood</strong>, allowing them to survive water temperatures near freezing without freezing themselves.</li>
      <li>🔹 Emperor penguins can <strong>lower their heart rate from 100 to 20 beats per minute</strong> while diving, conserving oxygen for underwater hunting, almost like a built-in scuba regulator.</li>
      <li>🔹 Penguins “toboggan” on their bellies not just for speed, it actually <strong>reduces energy expenditure by 30% over long distances</strong> across ice.</li>
      <li>🔹 They have <strong>special glands above their eyes</strong> that filter salt from seawater, so they can drink ocean water safely; a natural desalination system.</li>
      <li>🔹 Some penguins can <strong>see UV light</strong>, which helps them detect fish in murky water and even track urine trails of prey, like underwater detectives.</li>
      <li>🔹 Chicks of certain penguin species can <strong>recognize their parent’s voice among thousands of other birds</strong>, even in deafening colony noise, like a superhuman auditory fingerprint system.</li>
      <li>🔹 Penguins can <strong>“freeze” one flipper in place while swimming</strong>, allowing them to glide with almost zero energy loss, similar to how airplanes use ailerons.</li>
      <li>🔹 They occasionally <strong>hunt cooperatively in coordinated groups</strong>, herding schools of fish into tight balls to make feeding easier, a strategy more commonly seen in dolphins than birds.</li>
