    <ul class="facts-list">

      <li>🔹 A giraffe’s heart is a literal powerhouse, it pumps blood with enough force to <strong>blast water 10 meters into the air</strong> if the blood could shoot straight upward.</li>
      <li>🔹 Their necks have <strong>the same number of vertebrae as humans (7)</strong>, but each vertebra can be over <strong>10 inches long</strong>.</li>
      <li>🔹 Giraffes have a <strong>powerful blood-pressure system</strong>: their blood pressure is <strong>twice as high as a human’s</strong>, the highest of any land mammal.</li>
      <li>🔹 When giraffes bend down to drink water, special valves in their neck <strong>shut off to prevent their brains from exploding with pressure</strong>.</li>
      <li>🔹 Their tongues are around <strong>45–50 cm long</strong>, strong enough to strip tough acacia leaves <strong>and flexible enough to clean their own ears</strong>.</li>
      <li>🔹 A giraffe’s kick can generate over <strong>2,000 pounds of force</strong>, strong enough to break a lion’s jaw or ribcage.</li>
      <li>🔹 Giraffes barely sleep: they get <strong>about 30 minutes of sleep per day</strong>, usually in tiny naps of 3–5 minutes.</li>
      <li>🔹 Baby giraffes drop <strong>about 6 feet</strong> to the ground at birth, that fall actually helps them take their first breath.</li>
