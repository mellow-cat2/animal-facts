    <ul class="facts-list">

      <li>🔹 Komodo dragons have <strong>a venomous bite</strong>, their saliva contains toxins that prevent blood clotting, lowering blood pressure and weakening prey.</li>
      <li>🔹 They can <strong>eat up to 80% of their body weight in one meal</strong>, swallowing prey almost whole using stretchy jaws and powerful neck muscles.</li>
      <li>🔹 Komodos have <strong>a unique hunting strategy</strong>: they bite prey, track it for hours or days while the venom and bacteria weaken it, and then finish the kill.</li>
      <li>🔹 Their sense of smell is astonishing, they can <strong>detect decaying meat from over 5 miles away</strong> using their forked tongue like a natural radar.</li>
      <li>🔹 Komodo dragons are <strong>capable of parthenogenesis</strong>, meaning females can reproduce without a male, <strong></strong>an extremely rare trait among vertebrates.</strong></li>
      <li>🔹 They have <strong>bony tails that act as whips</strong>, capable of delivering powerful, bone-crushing blows to predators or rivals.</li>
      <li>🔹 Despite being apex predators, Komodos are <strong>fast and agile</strong>, able to run at 12 mph in short bursts to ambush prey.</li>
      <li>🔹 Their skin is reinforced with <strong>osteoderms</strong>, tiny bones embedded under the skin, acting like natural armor against attacks.</li>
