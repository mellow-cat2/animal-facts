    <ul class="facts-list">

      <li>🔹 Despite their zebra-like stripes on their legs, okapis are actually the <strong>closest living relatives of giraffes</strong>.</li>
      <li>🔹 Okapis have <strong>extremely long tongues (up to 18 inches)</strong>, perfect for grabbing leaves and grooming themselves, even cleaning their eyes and ears!</li>
      <li>🔹 They are incredibly <strong>elusive and shy</strong>, living deep in the rainforests of the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is why they were unknown to the western world until 1901.</li>
      <li>🔹 Okapis have <strong>excellent hearing and smell</strong>, which helps them avoid predators in dense forests.</li>
      <li>🔹 They communicate mostly through <strong>low-frequency sounds</strong> that humans can’t hear, like secret forest whispers.</li>
      <li>🔹 An okapi’s neck is shorter than a giraffe’s, but it’s <strong>still strong enough to reach leaves several meters high</strong>.</li>
      <li>🔹 Female okapis give birth to <strong>a single calf every 14–15 months</strong>, and newborns can stand and walk within <strong>30 minutes</strong> of birth.</li>
      <li>🔹 Their striped legs act as <strong>camouflage in the shadows of the forest</strong>, helping them hide from predators like leopards.</li>
