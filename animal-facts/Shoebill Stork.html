    <ul class="facts-list">

      <li>🔹 Shoebills can <strong>stand completely still for hours</strong>, waiting for prey, some scientists call it “zombie-like hunting patience.”</li>
      <li>🔹 Their huge, shoe-shaped bill can <strong>crush turtles and snails with astonishing force</strong>, making them apex predators in swampy waters.</li>
      <li>🔹 Shoebills are known for their <strong>“bill-clattering” sound</strong>, used in communication, it can be loud enough to echo across swamps.</li>
      <li>🔹 Despite looking prehistoric, they have <strong>excellent reflexes</strong>, able to strike and grab lungfish in under a second. 🐟</li>
      <li>🔹 Shoebills sometimes <strong>hunt cooperatively with young crocodiles</strong>, patiently waiting while the crocs herd fish, an unusual example of cross-species tolerance.</li>
      <li>🔹 Their eyes are <strong>positioned forward</strong>, giving them depth perception like a hawk, but their massive head and bill make them look hilariously awkward.</li>
      <li>🔹 Shoebills can grow up to <strong>5 feet tall</strong>, but they move extremely slowly and deliberately, adding to their eerie, almost “dinosaur-like” appearance.</li>
      <li>🔹 They are surprisingly silent while walking, thanks to <strong>soft feather padding on their feet</strong>, making them stealthy despite their size.</li>
