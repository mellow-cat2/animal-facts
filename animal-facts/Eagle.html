    <ul class="facts-list">

      <li>🔹 Eagles have <strong>exceptional vision</strong>, up to 8 times sharper than humans, allowing them to spot a rabbit from over 2 miles away.</li>
      <li>🔹 They can <strong>see ultraviolet light</strong>, which helps them track prey by spotting urine trails invisible to humans.</li>
      <li>🔹 Some eagle species, like the <strong>Golden Eagle</strong>, can dive at speeds over <strong>150 mph</strong>, making them one of the fastest birds of prey.</li>
      <li>🔹 Eagles have a <strong>special bony ridge above their eyes</strong>, which acts like sunglasses, reducing glare while hunting during the day.</li>
      <li>🔹 They can <strong>rotate their heads nearly 270 degrees</strong>, similar to owls, allowing them to scan their surroundings efficiently.</li>
      <li>🔹 Eagles are <strong>long-lived birds</strong>, some species can live up to <strong>30 years in the wild</strong> and even longer in captivity.</li>
      <li>🔹 Unlike most birds, eagles <strong>mate for life</strong> and engage in aerial “courtship dances” involving complex spirals and dives.</li>
      <li>🔹 Eagles have been observed <strong>stealing prey from other birds mid-flight</strong>, a behavior known as kleptoparasitism.</li>
