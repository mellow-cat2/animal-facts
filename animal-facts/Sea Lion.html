    <ul class="facts-list">

      <li>🔹 Sea lions can <strong>slow their heart rate from 80 bpm to under 20 bpm</strong> while diving, directing blood only to vital organs like the brain.</li>
      <li>🔹 They can hold their breath for <strong>8-12 minutes</strong>, and expert divers have recorded dives past <strong>900 feet</strong>, deeper than many sharks go.</li>
      <li>🔹 Sea lions have <strong>vibrissae (whiskers)</strong> so sensitive they can detect tiny water vibrations, even tracking fish by the waves they leave behind.</li>
      <li>🔹 They use their front flippers like <strong>giant underwater wings</strong>, giving them one of the most efficient swimming styles among marine mammals.</li>
      <li>🔹 Sea lions <strong>recognize individual voices</strong> within their massive colonies, even with thousands of animals all calling at once.</li>
      <li>🔹 Their pupils can rapidly <strong>shift shape</strong> to adjust for bright sunlight on land and darkness underwater, like living camera lenses.</li>
      <li>🔹 Sea lions have been trained to <strong>detect underwater mines</strong> and even help the U.S. Navy with recovery missions due to their intelligence and agility.</li>
      <li>🔹 They can sleep <strong>in the ocean</strong> by floating vertically with their noses above water, a behavior called <strong>“bottling.”</strong></li>
