    <ul class="facts-list">

      <li>🔹 Some tortoises, like the Galápagos giant tortoise, can <strong>live over 150 years</strong>, making them one of the longest-living land animals.</li>
      <li>🔹 Tortoises have <strong>amazing memory and navigation skills</strong>, able to find water sources or familiar feeding areas even after years away.</li>
      <li>🔹 They can <strong>store water in their bladder</strong> for long periods, helping them survive droughts, a natural water reservoir.</li>
      <li>🔹 Tortoises have <strong>remarkable regenerative abilities</strong>; their shells can repair minor cracks and injuries over time.</li>
      <li>🔹 Some species can <strong>go without food for months</strong>, relying on fat reserves in their tail and limbs.</li>
      <li>🔹 Tortoises have <strong>sensitive vision and touch</strong>, allowing them to detect predators or changes in their environment despite slow movement.</li>
      <li>🔹 They can <strong>hear vibrations through the ground</strong>, sensing nearby animals without using their ears.</li>
      <li>🔹 Tortoises’ shells are <strong>living bones covered by keratin</strong>, with blood vessels and nerves, so they feel pressure and pain, not just a passive shield.</li>
