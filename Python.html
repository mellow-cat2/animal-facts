    <ul class="facts-list">

      <li>🔹 Pythons can <strong>sense heat through specialized pits</strong> along their jawline, allowing them to detect warm-blooded prey even in complete darkness.</li>
      <li>🔹 They are capable of <strong>expanding their jaws and skin</strong> to swallow prey much larger than their heads, including animals heavier than themselves.</li>
      <li>🔹 Some pythons, like the reticulated python, can <strong>travel surprisingly long distances</strong>, up to 1.5 miles in a single night while hunting.</li>
      <li>🔹 Pythons have a <strong>slow metabolism and can survive months between meals</strong>, depending on the size of their last catch.</li>
      <li>🔹 Certain species display <strong>brooding behavior</strong>, females will coil around eggs and <strong>shiver their muscles to generate heat</strong>, keeping eggs warm until hatching.</li>
      <li>🔹 Pythons can <strong>“taste” the air using their forked tongue</strong>, collecting scent particles and delivering them to the Jacobson’s organ in the roof of their mouth for precise tracking.</li>
      <li>🔹 Some pythons have been documented <strong>attacking and killing crocodiles</strong>, showing they can take down formidable predators despite being non-venomous.</li>
      <li>🔹 Pythons can <strong>slow their heart rate dramatically</strong> while digesting large prey, conserving energy over several weeks during the slow digestion process.</li>
