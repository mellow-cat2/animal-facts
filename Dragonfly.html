    <h1><strong>Mind-Blowing Dragonfly Facts</strong></h1>

    <ul class="facts-list">

      <li><strong>Masters of flight</strong> Dragonflies can fly forwards, backwards, sideways, and even hover in place, making them some of the most agile and precise fliers in the insect world.</li>
      <li><strong>Incredible eyesight</strong> Their compound eyes cover almost their entire head, giving them nearly 360-degree vision. They can detect the slightest movement from meters away, which helps them catch fast-moving prey midair.</li>
      <li><strong>Ancient survivors</strong> Dragonflies have existed for over 300 million years. Some prehistoric species had wingspans up to 2 feet, making them true giants compared to modern dragonflies.</li>
      <li><strong>Lightning-fast hunters</strong> Adult dragonflies can catch their prey midair with astonishing accuracy. Their hunting success rate exceeds 95 percent, which is almost unheard of in the animal kingdom.</li>
      <li><strong>Independent wing movement</strong> Each of their four wings can move separately. This allows extreme maneuverability, rapid acceleration, and the ability to perform aerial stunts that few other creatures can replicate.</li>
      <li><strong>Aquatic beginnings</strong> Dragonfly nymphs live underwater for years. They breathe through gills, hunt small aquatic creatures, and molt multiple times before emerging as adults capable of flight.</li>
      <li><strong>Pollution indicators</strong> Dragonflies are highly sensitive to water quality. Their presence or absence in a habitat can reveal the health of freshwater ecosystems.</li>
      <li><strong>Long-distance travelers</strong> Some dragonfly species migrate hundreds of kilometers across oceans and continents. They use wind currents and innate navigation skills to find breeding grounds far from where they were born.</li>
