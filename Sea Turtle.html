    <ul class="facts-list">

      <li>🔹 Sea turtles can use <strong>Earth’s magnetic field</strong>, using it like a built-in GPS. Baby turtles memorize their beach’s magnetic “signature” before they leave.</li>
      <li>🔹 Female sea turtles return to <strong>exact same beach where they were born</strong>, even if they’ve traveled thousands of miles and haven’t been there for decades.</li>
      <li>🔹 Leatherback sea turtles can dive over, <strong>200 meters deep</strong>, reaching depths rivaling whales, the deepest-diving reptiles on Earth.</li>
      <li>🔹 Their shells are extremely sensitive; sea turtles can feel <strong>pressure, touch, and even pain</strong> through their shells because they’re living bone and nerve tissue.</li>
      <li>🔹 Sea turtles have <strong>salt glands near their eyes</strong> that remove excess salt from seawater. This makes it look like they’re crying when they come on land.</li>
      <li>🔹 A sea turtle’s jaw shape changes by species, some have <strong>sharp, beak-like mouths</strong> for jellyfish, while others have crushing jaws for hard-shelled prey.</li>
      <li>🔹 Leatherbacks can <strong>regulate their body temperature</strong>, staying warm in cold water, a rare ability for reptiles.</li>
      <li>🔹 Sea turtles can hold their breath for <strong>hours</strong> when resting, slowing their heartbeat to as little as <strong>beat every 9 minutes</strong> to conserve oxygen.</li>
