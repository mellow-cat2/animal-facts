      <li>🔹 Gila monsters are one of the <strong>few venomous lizards in the world</strong>, but they deliver venom slowly through grooves in their teeth rather than striking like snakes.</li>
      <li>🔹 They can <strong>store fat in their tails</strong>, which allows them to survive months without food, a natural desert survival adaptation.</li>
      <li>🔹 Their venom contains <strong>powerful compounds</strong> that have inspired medicines for treating diabetes, including insulin-regulating drugs.</li>
      <li>🔹 Gila monsters have a <strong>strong sense of smell</strong>, using their forked tongue to detect prey underground, such as eggs and small mammals.</li>
      <li>🔹 Despite being slow, they have <strong>camouflage</strong>, blending perfectly with desert rocks and soil to ambush prey or avoid predators.</li>
      <li>🔹 They are <strong>long-lived for reptiles</strong>, sometimes surviving up to <strong>20–30 years in the wild</strong> and even longer in captivity.</li>
      <li>🔹 Gila monsters are mostly <strong>nocturnal</strong>, but they can <strong>thermoregulate</strong> by basking during cooler periods, balancing heat for optimal hunting efficiency.</li>
      <li>🔹 Their jaws are surprisingly <strong>strong for their size</strong>, able to hold onto prey or defend themselves from predators with a painful, lingering bite.</li>
