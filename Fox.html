    <ul class="facts-list">
      <li>🔹 Foxes have a unique ability called <strong>"magnetic alignment hunting"</strong>, they use Earth’s magnetic field to calculate the perfect angle for pouncing on prey.</li>

      <li>🔹 A fox’s scream can be heard from <strong>over a mile away</strong>; they use these eerie calls mostly during mating season.</li>

      <li>🔹 They can see in <strong>ultraviolet light</strong>, allowing them to detect tiny urine trails and hidden animals humans can’t see.</li>

      <li>🔹 Foxes store food by burying it, but here’s the wild part, they orient the storage using <strong>the sun’s position</strong> like a built-in compass.</li>

      <li>🔹 Urban foxes have evolved to understand <strong>traffic patterns</strong>, learning to cross streets between certain hours to avoid cars.</li>

      <li>🔹 A fox’s whiskers extend to its forelegs, helping it sense the exact width of spaces and navigate tight areas in the dark.</li>

      <li>🔹 They communicate with more than <strong>40 different vocal sounds</strong>, including coughs, chirps, chatters, and high-pitched barks.</li>

      <li>🔹 Arctic foxes can survive temperatures as low as <strong>−50°C (−58°F)</strong>, thanks to the warmest fur of any animal their size.</li>
    </ul>
