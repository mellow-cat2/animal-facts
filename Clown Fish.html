    <ul class="facts-list">

      <li>🔹 Every clownfish is <strong>male</strong>, their entire species has a built-in gender-switch system. The dominant male can transform into a <strong>functioning female</strong> if the group’s female dies.</li>
      <li>🔹 Clownfish don’t <strong>just</strong> live in anemones, they actually <strong>“farm” their anemone</strong>, keeping it clean and increasing water circulation so it grows larger.</li>
      <li>🔹 Their bright colors aren't for show, they contain <strong>natural sunscreen pigments</strong> that protect them from UV rays in shallow tropical waters.</li>
      <li>🔹 A clownfish’s mucus coat doesn’t just prevent stings; it <strong>chemically disguises them</strong> so well that the anemone treats them like part of its body.</li>
      <li>🔹 Clownfish and their anemone share <strong>nutrients through poop</strong>, the fish’s waste fertilizes the anemone, which then grows bigger, offering more protection.</li>
      <li>🔹 They have precise <strong>“chirps” and “pops”</strong> used for communication, dominance, and territory defense, almost like underwater walkie-talkies.</li>
      <li>🔹 Clownfish live in strict hierarchies:<br>
          - Largest = dominant female <br> 
          - Second largest = breeding male <br> 
          - All others = non-breeding males <br> 
          If the female dies, the male <strong>immediately transforms</strong>.</li>
      <li>🔹 Clownfish eggs are guarded so carefully that males <strong>fan the eggs for days</strong>, cleaning them and increasing oxygen flow until they hatch.</li>
