    <ul class="facts-list">

      <li>🔹 Jellyfish have existed for more than <strong>500 million years</strong>, meaning they are older than dinosaurs, trees, and even sharks.</li>
      <li>🔹 Some jellyfish species are <strong>biologically immortal</strong>. The <strong>Turritopsis dohrnii</strong> can revert back to its juvenile form instead of dying.</li>
      <li>🔹 They have <strong>no brain, heart, lungs, or bones</strong>, yet they can survive in every ocean in the world.</li>
      <li>🔹 A jellyfish is made of about <strong>95% water</strong>, making them almost invisible in the ocean when sunlight hits them.</li>
      <li>🔹 Their tentacles can still react even when detached, this is because jellyfish cells fire automatically without a brain.</li>
      <li>🔹 The largest jellyfish, the <strong>Lion’s Mane Jellyfish</strong>, can have tentacles that extend over <strong>36 meters (118 ft)</strong>, longer than a blue whale.</li>
      <li>🔹 Some jellyfish glow using <strong>bioluminescence</strong>, creating natural underwater light shows.</li>
