    <ul class="facts-list">

      <li>🔹 Owls have <strong>asymmetrically placed ears</strong>, allowing them to pinpoint the location of sounds with incredible accuracy, even in total darkness.</li>
      <li>🔹 Their eyes are <strong>tubular, not spherical</strong>, which gives them superior depth perception but makes them unable to move their eyes; they rotate their heads up to <strong>270 degrees</strong> to see around.</li>
      <li>🔹 Owls have <strong>silent flight</strong> due to specialized feathers that reduce turbulence, they can swoop down on prey without making a sound.</li>
      <li>🔹 Some species, like the <strong>Barn Owl</strong>, can hear a mouse moving under snow or leaves from <strong>over 100 feet away</strong>.</li>
      <li>🔹 Owls can <strong>swallow prey whole</strong>, and later regurgitate indigestible parts like bones and fur as pellets, scientists can study these to learn about their diet.</li>
      <li>🔹 They can <strong>turn their heads so far because of extra neck vertebrae</strong>: 14 in total, compared to 7 in humans.</li>
      <li>🔹 Owls’ feathers have <strong>tiny comb-like edges</strong> that muffle sound, making them near-perfect stealth hunters.</li>
      <li>🔹 Some owls, like the <strong>Great Horned Owl</strong>, can take down prey <strong>larger than themselves</strong>, including rabbits and even other birds of prey.</li>
