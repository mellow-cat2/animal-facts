    <ul class="facts-list">

      <li>🔹 Crocodiles can <strong>go months without eating</strong> by lowering their metabolism and surviving on stored energy, true survival experts of the wild.</li>
      <li>🔹 They have a <strong>“palatal valve” in their throat</strong> that allows them to open their mouths underwater without drowning, a natural submarine feature.</li>
      <li>🔹 Crocodiles perform <strong>“death-feigning” to hunt prey</strong>, remaining almost invisible in the water, with only eyes and nostrils exposed.</li>
      <li>🔹 Their heart is incredibly advanced, it has <strong>4 chambers with special valves</strong> that allow them to <strong>shunt blood away from the lungs while diving</strong>, conserving oxygen efficiently.</li>
      <li>🔹 Crocodiles can <strong>run surprisingly fast on land</strong> for short bursts, up to 17 mph, despite their bulky, armored body.</li>
      <li>🔹 They exhibit <strong>cooperative hunting behavior</strong>; multiple crocs will herd fish or even hunt in pairs to trap prey.</li>
      <li>🔹 Crocodiles have been observed <strong>using tools</strong>, such as placing sticks on their heads to lure birds during nesting season, clever ambush tactics.</li>
      <li>🔹 Crocs can <strong>replace teeth continuously</strong>, growing over 50,000 teeth in a lifetime.</li>
