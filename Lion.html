    <ul class="facts-list">
      <li><strong>Lions are the only cats that live in groups</strong>,but the surprising part is: the females run everything. They decide when to hunt, move, or rest.</li>

      <li>A lion’s <strong>roar can be heard from 8 km (5 miles) away</strong>,but they mostly roar to show off, not to attack.</li>

      <li>Lions sleep <strong>up to 20 hours a day</strong>, making them one of the laziest hunters on Earth.</li>

      <li>Lionesses do <strong>about 90% of the hunting</strong>, while males protect territory… but males eat first at the kill.</li>
      <li>A lion’s mane acts like <strong>natural armor</strong>;the thicker and darker it is, the more intimidating he appears to rivals.</li>

      <li>Despite being called the “king,” lions can’t climb as well as leopards,<strong>leopards can steal their food and hide it in trees</strong> where lions can’t reach.</li>

      <li>Lions once lived in Europe and the Middle East,<strong>they were common in Greece</strong> thousands of years ago.</li>

      <li>Lions communicate with <strong>more than 20 different vocal sounds</strong>, including “moans,” which sound surprisingly gentle.</li>
